<center><h1>CARBON HAS FOUR FRIENDS<br/>
INSTRUCTION: KIDS AGES 3-8</center></h1>

<p>This is instructions for the adult to play the tactile version of the game, “Carbon has four friends” with a young child.  
The child needs to be able to count to ten, 
recognize that colors are different and know that the name of a number refers to a certain amount of objects. </p>
<p> This is carbon.(Pick up white sugar packet.) He is an atom. He has four arms which means he has four hands. 
He likes to hold someone else’s hand with one of his and likes to use all his hands. 
He likes to have four friends. </p>
<p>He has a friend, another atom, named  Hydrogen. (Pick up blue sweetener packet.)  But Hydrogen has only one hand. </p>
<p>But we have lots of Hydrogens. What do we do? </p>
<p>Now we have just created  a simple carbon chain. </p>
<p>These chains have different names depending on how many carbons you have. </p>
<p>So just one carbon with hydrogen friends gets a funny name. It’s name is methane. How many Hydrogen friends? 4 of course. </p>
<p>Two carbon's name is ethane. How many Hydrogen friends?  6</p>
<p>Three carbons with hydrogen friends is ... propane. How many Hydrogen friends?  8 </p>
<p>Four carbons with hydrogen friends is... butane. How many Hydrogen friends?  10</p>
<p>Don’t forget to let the child take turns with you putting out packet and taking some away for your to finish hydrogenating your chain. </p>
<center><h2>My point is science is everywhere; science is fun. Everywhere can be made more fun with science. <br/>
We don’t wait for children to know how to read to teach them the alphabet. <br/>
Just have fun with science everywhere, no matter what the age. </center></h2>
