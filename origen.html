<center><h1>ORIGEN OF GAME</h1></center>

<center><img src="bentoboxdiagonal.png"></center>

<p>My youngest picked her favorite restaurant for lunch one day. There was a long wait for her bento box. 
During that long wait the dreaded wait for food appeared and so did the most dreaded game in our household.</p>
<p>It’s really a great game called “Guess the Animal”. It teaches kids about animals, not just want they say or 
what color they are but about any kind of related information like what a mammal is and anything else you can 
think of as you expand their knowledge and curiosity futrher and further.
<p>Both kids loved it. I did too but as a grown-up it is hard to play that game nearly every day and at every opportunity, </p>
<p>So while we waited with only white, blue, pink and yellow packets of sugar and  sweetener for amusement for my four year old, a new game was invented.  
Different names were assigned to the sugar packets and different relationships to this colorful packets. </p>
<p>This game was called “Carbon has four friends”. </p>
<p>Carbon was white and had four arms. He wants to hold hands with four friends. </p>
<p>Hydrogen was blue had just one arm and cold only hold one hand. </p>
<p>To play, some number of white carbons were put on the table in a row. 
Then the child would figure out how many blue hydrogens to add. </p>
<p>After playing back and forth as it is very much fun for the child to make the grownup do the same things, then a new atom was added, oxygen.</p>
<p>After doing simple chains, we worked on pardon played with simple branched chains. Sometimes I would cover my eyes while my daughter would remove some for me to guess which ones were missing. </p>
<p>That is the inspiration for this page and a start for the kid’s chemistry page I hope to do one day. I hope you enjoy. </p>
